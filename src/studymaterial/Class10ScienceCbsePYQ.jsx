          "The decomposition of ferrous sulfate crystals involves heating them, which produces gases that can be harmful. The reaction is:\n$2FeSO_{4}(s)\\xrightarrow{Heat} Fe_{2}O_{3}(s)+SO_{2}(g)+SO_{3}(g)$\n\nTwo precautions a student must observe while performing this experiment:\n1.  **Safety with gases:** Sulfur dioxide ($SO_{2}$) and sulfur trioxide ($SO_{3}$) are pungent-smelling, corrosive, and toxic gases. The student should perform the experiment in a **well-ventilated area or under a fume hood** to avoid inhaling the gases. The mouth of the boiling tube should be directed away from themselves and others.\n2.  **Handling hot glassware and avoiding backflow:** The boiling tube will become very hot. The student should use **test tube holders** to handle the hot boiling tube. Also, if there is any moisture on the outside of the boiling tube or if the products condense in cooler parts of the tube and then flow back onto the hot glass, it could cause the glass to crack or break. The student should ensure the boiling tube is dry and the setup prevents backflow (e.g., by slightly tilting the boiling tube downwards at the mouth if condensed water is a concern, though for gases, directing away is primary).",

        solution:
          "(a) **Can a displacement reaction be a redox reaction?**\n    Yes, a displacement reaction **can be a redox reaction**.\n\n    **Explanation with an example:** In a displacement reaction, a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound. This process invariably involves a change in the oxidation states of the participating elements, meaning one substance is oxidized (loses electrons) and another is reduced (gains electrons).\n\n    **Example:** Reaction of iron with copper sulfate solution.\n    $Fe(s)+CuSO_{4}(aq)\\rightarrow FeSO_{4}(aq)+Cu(s)$\n    * Here, Iron (Fe) goes from an oxidation state of 0 to +2 (in $FeSO_{4}$). It **loses electrons**, so it is **oxidized**.\n    * Copper (Cu) in $CuSO_{4}$ (with oxidation state +2) goes to elemental copper (with oxidation state 0). It **gains electrons**, so it is **reduced**.\n    Since both oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously, this displacement reaction is also a redox reaction.\n\n(b) **Type of chemical reaction:**\n    (i) **Reaction between an acid and a base:** This is a **Neutralisation reaction**.
